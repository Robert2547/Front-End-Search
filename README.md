# Front-End-Search
Project Description:

This project aims to create a re-implementation of the front-end for Google's homepage, including Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.
It is part of the CS50 project, where the goal is to explore and understand Google's interface by identifying the necessary GET parameters it expects and incorporating them into a custom website.

The front-end design includes a search bar where users can enter their queries, and two buttons: "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky." 
The search functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle user input and perform the search operation.

Additionally, the project incorporates a dark and light theme toggle switch, allowing users to switch between different visual styles.
The switch modifies the background color, text color, and image of the page to provide a consistent user experience.

The project demonstrates the understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality to create an interactive and visually appealing front-end interface.
By exploring Google's interface, the implementation ensures compatibility with Google's search functionality, while also providing a customized and user-friendly experience.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to re-implement a front-end design similar to Google's homepage, while expanding on the functionality and design to create a unique and personalized user experience.
